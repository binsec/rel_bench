/**
 * @def wcsrtombs_s(retvalp,dest,dmax,srcp,len,ps)
 * @brief
 *    Does not permit the \c ps parameter (the pointer to the conversion state)
 *    to be a null pointer.
 *    The restartable \c wcsrtombs_s function converts a sequence of
 *    wide characters from the array whose first element is pointed to by
 *    \c *srcp to to its narrow multibyte representation from the current
 *    LC_CTYPE locale that begins in the conversion state described by \c *ps.
 *    If \c dest is not null, converted characters are
 *    stored in the successive elements of \c dest. No more than \c len bytes
 *    written to the destination array. Each wide character is
 *    converted as if by a call to \c wcrtomb.  \c wcsrtombs_s
 *    clobbers the destination array from the terminating null and
 *    until \c dmax. In extension to \c wcstombs_s you can re-use the
 *    state via \c ps.
 *
 *    The conversion stops if:
 *
 *    - The wide null character \c L'\0' was converted and stored.
 *      The bytes stored in this case are the unshift sequence (if necessary)
 *      followed by \c '\0', \c *srcp is set to \c NULL and \c *ps represents
 *      the initial shift state.
 *
 *    - A \c wchar_t was found that does not correspond to a valid character
 *      in the current LC_CTYPE locale. \c *srcp is set to point at the first
 *      unconverted wide character.
 *
 *    - the next multibyte character to be stored would exceed \c len.
 *      \c *srcp is set to point at the beginning of the first unconverted
 *      wide character. This condition is not checked if \c dst==NULL.
 *
 *    With SAFECLIB_STR_NULL_SLACK defined all elements following the
 *    terminating null character (if any) written in the array of dmax
 *    characters pointed to by dest are nulled. Also in the error cases for
 *    srcp = NULL, *srcp = NULL, ESNOSPC and EILSEQ.
 *
 * @remark SPECIFIED IN
 *    * C11 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2011):
 *    K.3.9.3.2.2 The wcsrtombs_s function (p: 649-650)
 *    http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/wide/wcsrtombs
 *    * ISO/IEC TR 24731, Programming languages, environments
 *    and system software interfaces, Extensions to the C Library,
 *    Part I: Bounds-checking interfaces
 *
 * @param[out]  retvalp pointer to a \c size_t object where the result will be
 * stored
 * @param[out]  dest  pointer to character array where the result will be
 * stored
 * @param[in]   dmax  restricted maximum length of \c dest
 * @param[in]   srcp  pointer to the wide string that will be copied to \c dest
 * @param[in]   len   maximum number of bytes to be written to \c dest
 * @param[in]   ps    pointer to the conversion state object
 *
 * @pre retvalp, ps, srcp, or *srcp shall not be a null pointer.
 * @pre dmax and len shall not be greater than \c RSIZE_MAX_STR
 *      (unless dest is null).
 * @pre dmax shall not equal zero (unless dest is null).
 * @pre dmax shall be greater than \c len.
 * @pre Copying shall not take place between objects that overlap.
 *
 * @note C11 uses RSIZE_MAX, not RSIZE_MAX_STR.
 * @note On the msvcrt with a NULL dest pointer, the retvalp length is limited
 *       by the srcp \c len. In other libc's \c len is ignored.
 *
 * @return  If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if \c dest
 *          is not a null pointer and \c dmax is greater than zero and
 *          not greater than RSIZE_MAX_STR, then \c wcsrtombs_s nulls \c dest.
 *          Then the number of bytes excluding terminating zero that were,
 *          or would be written to \c dest, is stored in \c *retvalp.
 * @note    Under the Windows sec_api the *retvalp result is +1.
 *
 * @retval  EOK        on successful conversion.
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when retvalp, ps, srcp or *srcp are a NULL pointer
 * @retval  ESZEROL    when dmax = 0, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESLEMAX    when dmax > RSIZE_MAX_STR, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  EOVERFLOW  when dmax or len > size of dest (optionally, when the
 *                     compiler knows the object_size statically), unless dest
 *                     is NULL
 * @retval  ESLEWRNG   when dmax != size of dest and --enable-error-dmax
 * @retval  ESOVRLP    when *srcp and dest overlap
 * @retval  ESNOSPC    when there is no null character in the first dmax
 *                     multibyte characters in the *srcp array and len is
 *                     greater than dmax (unless dest is null)
 * @retval  EILSEQ     if returned by wctomb()
